# recipe-book

*project done during the SPICED academy Full Stack Web Development bootcamp* <br/>

Recipe Book is a central location where users can store and organise their favourite recipes. Users can register, login, search their recipes and filter through them. They can prepare menus and generate a grocery list. The insertion of recipes can be done manually or with the help of a scraper supported on some webpages (due to the personal use of recipes in our webpage).
